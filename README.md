- [x] Do the [Official Tutorial for Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/)
- [x] Start a [mildly-cool web project](https://github.com/itsnamgyu/mogakco)
- [ ] Think about the pre-requisites needed to implement the next mildy-cool feature
- [ ] Do the official tutorial covering that pre-requisite on this repo
- [ ] Over-document everything on this repo
- [ ] Implement the mildy-cool feature on the mildly-cool project
- [ ] Repeat

Tutorial documentation can be found in [the wiki](https://github.com/itsnamgyu/django-two/wiki)
